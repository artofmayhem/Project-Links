### Scribble Stadium
- This is enterprise level application is an online gaming platform that will allow Parents to sign their children up for a number of games that are deigned to stimulate the imagination while avoiding constant screen time through clevely devised gaming interface. Scribble Stadium allows users to read a story starter and, over a 7 day period, allows the child to create their own ending and create a drawing. These assets will be paired with another team mate to "battle" other teams for votes and wins. 
- As a Team Project Manager for this project I was tasked with taking the project from a broken state and reorganizing the code base, cleaning up deprecated code, testing and planning all work necessary to put the project back on track. 
- I contributed to *[documentation](https://github.com/BloomTech-Labs/scribble-stadium-fe/blob/feature/adding-route-documentation/DOCUMENTATION/ROUTING.md)* with a route mapping and status of all current routes along with planning notes for future potential usage for legacy code.
