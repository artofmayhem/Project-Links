Welcome to my projects page. This is where some of my favorite projects that I've worked on are linked and discussed. There have been so many learnings along the way on my path to becoming a fantastic developer. These are a few of my favorites...

(all projects represented here are 100% coded by me)

1. Stark Labworks - This Marvel API and Weather API project was built using react and bootstrap and using three different api calls. The first two calls are made to weatherapi.com and displays location details based on user input. It also displays, current conditions as well as the astronomy report. The third api call is a search function that displays any marvel character along with appearances from the Marvel APi. This project was fun because I taught myself how to overcome the race condition caused by using useEffect.

2. Street Art Magazine - This is the front end of a scratch react app project from school. All code and concept was done by me. The object was to create a friends list with the ability to post new friends, login, and logout using the custom hoo useAxiosWithAuth to authenticate and push a token to localStorage. This project was fun because I taught myself parallax design using SCSS and this project was an entire front end that I did over the course of two days. I also learned to overcome the netlify router error using a netlify.toml file that tells the redirects to go to index.html vs /. It was made using react, react router, material ui, and a node.js api server that I taught myself and designed.

3. The Pulse - This app was built from scratch using create-react-app, while using bootstrap, material ui, react router, and Deezer music's api. The app allows user to choose from a daily created playlist, a weekly playlist and an artist spotlight playlist. 

I had fun with this project because I did this in 45 mins before class started to see if I could get a full app up and running with API call and rendering data in an elegant way. I later came back and added my own graphic design features for the header and playlist buttons.

4. - This todo list app was a class project that was a blast to create! I used react, material ui, redux, and gsap animation library. This was a very fun and creative project that really tested me in setting up redux. It was alot of work but well worth the effort and extra push. I taught myself hose to use gsap animation with react. This project was designed to be a simple todo list with an input and button and display. I stretched my own goals to include a beautiful responsive design with animation.

 5. SONVR Design - This side project site started as a concept for a design house. This was my first real project at Lambda and was originally created on codepen in HTML and CSS but recently transferred to reactjs. This site was a great learning experience as I taught myself pure css parallax effect and utilized some of my own photography for inspiration.

 6. Empowerment Magazine - This site was another fun side project where i created a soundtrack to go along with my pure HTML and CSS site. It was created on codepen as one of my first projects at Lambda. The concept is a digital magazine to boost women's empowerment. There were many design elements that I had to teach myself for this project. The first was how to embed video as playing video as part of the scrolling process. Another as learning to contain overflow in css.

 7. Space Digest - This was my second shot at using the react hook useEffect to dig into an API. This site uses Space News API and renders articles in a random order or in a linear order from the server. I really took the time to learn more deeply about how to pull all of the information available on a server to render. I taught myself the search techniques over the course of about a month, slowly building while completing other projects.

 8. NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day - This site was completed in two parts. the first part was my first API call. I learned all about useEffect and took the idea of pulling all data coming from the API onto the screen. 

 The second part came after learning more about search function and incorporates a three pronged attack on the search function feature. I added a second API call to NASA's Mars rover API and created a search that allows the user to choose between rovers, camera location and day of operation on Mars. This was a very fun project because i love all things space and technology

 9. GRUBSPACE - This project was fun but intense. I designed the entire front end using react, redux, material ui, and yup as well as two different API's. The first API makes a call to spoonacular and utilizes the data to display recipes that can be searched by any parameter to display recipes that can be traveled to by the user. It allows for login/ logout authentication and creates a personal recipe box for the user to add, update and delete recipes. 

 This project was designed to be completed by a four person front end team over two weeks. I was the only front end dev on the project. It was a good experience and i learned how to create logic that allows the user to increment ingredient and method step inputs.

 10. Lambda Pizza - this restaurant site was built as a sprint project for Lambda school. The parameters were only to create a pizza ordering system with limited ordering ability and a simple interface. I brought in react-router, cypress and yup and created a full site including menus and graphic design.
