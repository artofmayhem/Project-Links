### These are a few of my favorite deploys and their corresponding repository...

## Anywhere Fitness Club -  This was a four person team build. On this project I handle initial project set up, overall style and design, handling CRUD application for the signup, login, and form submission utilizing redux to manage state. I also pair coded the scaffolding with my partner to layout the initial redux so that we both understood the initial set up and where everything needed to be so that we could access the parts we needed to in full awareness of the layout. The site was built using react, redux, styled styled components, bootstrap, scss, yup, cyprerss and stripe.

## Street Art Magazine - This is the front end of a scratch react app project from school. All code and concept was done by me. The object was to create a friends list with the ability to post new friends, login, and logout using the custom hoo useAxiosWithAuth to authenticate and push a token to localStorage. This project was fun because I taught myself parallax design using SCSS and this project was an entire front end that I did over the course of two days. I also learned to overcome the netlify router error using a netlify.toml file that tells the redirects to go to index.html vs /. It was made using react, react router, material ui, and a node.js api server that I taught myself and designed.

## Adidas Product Portal - This project is a full CRA build using authentication, and form submission on the front end, Backend is build in nodejs with express and SQL while building my own custom middleware. The user can login using the the username: lambda password: school to see the products available to the stores. I used the coding and design practices found at adidas' github as the basic set of tenets for design. The stack used for the front end development was react, material ui, bootstrap, on the fronf end.
