Hi My name is Tony! 


I'm a fullstack developer based in Honolulu. Welcome to my projects page. This is where some of my favorite projects that I've worked on are linked and discussed. There have been so many learnings along the way on my path to becoming a fantastic developer. 

 These are the languages that I'm currently using for web development!

These are a few of my favorite deploys and their corresponding repository...

Anywhere Fitness Club -This was a four person team build. On this project I handle initial project set up, overall style and design, handling CRUD application for the signup, login, and form submission utilizing redux to manage state. I also pair coded the scaffolding with my partner to layout the initial redux so that we both understood the initial set up and where everything needed to be so that we could access the parts we needed to in full awareness of the layout. The site was built using react, redux, styled styled components, bootstrap, scss, yup, cyprerss and stripe.

Water My Plants App - This was a five person team build. For this project I was responsible for making forms, providing animation, form validation using yup, and testing using cypress. I also handled all styling and layout of the UI. THe front end was built using context api to manage state. Libraries utilized for this build included storybook, material ui, bootstrap, and gsap. This project i learned conditional rendering of elements and components based on current state.

 Street Art Magazine - This is the front end of a scratch react app project from school. All code and concept was done by me. The object was to create a friends list with the ability to post new friends, login, and logout using the custom hoo useAxiosWithAuth to authenticate and push a token to localStorage. This project was fun because I taught myself parallax design using SCSS and this project was an entire front end that I did over the course of two days. I also learned to overcome the netlify router error using a netlify.toml file that tells the redirects to go to index.html vs /. It was made using react, react router, material ui, and a node.js api server that I taught myself and designed.

  Adidas Product Portal - This project is a full CRA build using authentication, and form submission on the front end, Backend is build in nodejs with express and SQL while building my own custom middleware. The user can login using the the username: lambda password: school to see the products available to the stores. I used the coding and design practices found at adidas' github as the basic set of tenets for design. The stack used for the front end development was react, material ui, bootstrap, on the fronf end.

   Space Digest - This was my second shot at using the react hook useEffect to dig into an API. This site uses Space News API and renders articles in a random order or in a linear order from the server. I really took the time to learn more deeply about how to pull all of the information available on a server to render. I taught myself the search techniques over the course of about a month, slowly building while completing other projects.

 The Pulse - This app was built from scratch using create-react-app, while using bootstrap, material ui, react router, and Deezer music's api. The app allows user to choose from a daily created playlist, a weekly playlist and an artist spotlight playlist. I took this project as a timed challenge to see if I could find and hit an api, render the data and style it in 45 mins. I later came back and added my own graphic design features for the header and playlist buttons.

 Syntech 3D - This particle animation uses threejs, drei, and react-three-fiber to create a ripple effect on a field of particles using sine as the formula to accomplish this. Bringing in Orbit controls from drei allows the user the contol the field. This is just a simple landing page idea but effective in it's usage of 3D animation.
